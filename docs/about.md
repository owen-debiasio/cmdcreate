# About cmdcreate

## How it came to be and a quick history

Around summer of 2025, I had a new project Idea. I wanted to make a tool that
would make it easier for me to create simplified versions of commands. This was
during when my older project
[Rusterminal](https://github.com/owen-debiasio/Rusterminal) was still in
development. I was running out of ideas for features for Rusterminal, so for the
next few weeks, I've been developing both cmdcreate and Rusterminal.

But later in August, I've decided to pull the plug on Rusterminal. The codebase
was messy, it had practically no use, and it just wasn't as fun to develop for
anymore. This decision allowed me to put all of my work and free time into this
small project.

Since then, I've been continuously improving, optimizing, and making cmdcreate
more useful, and I will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.

## How I manage to maintain the project

I'm the only one actively maintaining cmdcreate. Pretty much everything I've
done in this repository have been decisions made by me. I have so much free time
on my hands where I can put that time into managing this project.

Managing this project has been super easy so far for the following reasons:

- Little to know community
  - I'm pretty much the only person that cares about this project. I have no
    community to maintain and keep under control.
- I do a little bit at a time
  - With every update and commit, I add very small, but frequent updates.
- It's fun and I've learned a lot.
  - This is a big part of it. Not only is it fun and I enjoy working on it, but
    I've learned a lot of things throughout the time working on cmdcreate.

I'm the only maintainer of the project. If a task was difficult for maintainers
of a popular project, the difficulty would be 10x that for me. That doesn't stop
me though. Although it may take longer, I can get through big tasks.

## What I have learned through working on cmdcreate

I've learned a lot. I've learned more about how Rust works, using git, managing
packages, markdown, Shell scripting, and how to take advantage of Github as a
whole. Without this project, I'd probably still be uploading each individual
file on the github website.

## Some other things

I have a couple other things to say that don't quite fit anywhere else...

- `cmdcreate` is written in lowercase at all times. It doesn't matter if it's in
  the beginning of a sentence, it's written in all lowercase.
- I don't have plans for updates. When I have ideas, I work on them right away.
- I don't care that no one else uses cmdcreate. The intended targeted user for
  this project is me. I made this project for myself.

## Contact me

If you have any issues for whatever reason about cmdcreate, you could either:

- Open an issue or PR
- Email me at: <owen.debiasio@gmail.com>

If what you have to say isn't about cmdcreate, I'll probably ignore it.
